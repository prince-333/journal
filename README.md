# This is my personal journal, basically talking about how I'm going to take on computer science :) Will cover my journey throughout this semester, as well as tutorials I go through with my own in depths notes on what occurs, errors, things to memorize, etc.


For the first few weeks, I'm going to review this 12 hours video from BroCode and take in-depth notes on them, trying to incorporate at least 1-2 hours everyday on this journal and studying.
