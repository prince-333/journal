# Statics was too much of a pain today, it took a little bit to understand so I put off working on this for a bit.
Though I still was able to update some summarized notes on all my coding on onenote, which is big because that's the part that matters quite a bit. Tomorrow I'll try to finish everything else and proceed with more sections and exercises from the BroCode's video.
Overall not a bad day, but could have been a million times more productive.

Daily minjeong!
