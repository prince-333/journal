# Pretty productive day overall. Leart logical operators, conditional expressions, and some very useful string methods.

Logical operators is very handy learning how to use ("or", "and", and "not).
Conditional expressions is basically just a shortcut to use if and else functions
String methods are very handy in certian scenarios, basically calculates a certain string whether it be characters, digits, specific string and replacing it, etc. VERY VERY USEFUL.
